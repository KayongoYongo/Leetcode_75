345. Reverse Vowels of a String

1. Convert the string to a list since strings are immutable.
2. Declare two pointers, one at the start and one at the end.
3. Declare an array to store the vowels in uppercase and lowercase.
4. Use a while loop with the limit (start < end).
5. Iterate through the list if the character is not a vowel.
6. Iterate throught the list if the character is still a vowel.
7. Complete the swap using the python inbuilt function s[start], s[end] = s[end], s[start]
8. Join the characters in the array using this function.  "".join.
